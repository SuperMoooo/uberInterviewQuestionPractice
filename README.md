## Live: https://supermoooo.github.io/uberInterviewQuestionPractice/

### Problem: 
In this question, the candidate needs to create a shape based on a given 2D array. A shape is a collection of empty boxes placed at values that are true in the provided array.
### Functional Requirement:
Create an empty box where array value is 1.
User can select a box. Upon selection the box background color should change to #0bcc59.
Once all boxes are selected then the boxes should auto-deselect based on the order of selection.
Deselection should be non-interruptible as in once started, we can't stop it.
During de-selection, user should not be able to select a new box as in disable any box interaction.
